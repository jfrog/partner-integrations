# Welcome to the JFrog Spoke Documentation

The JFrog Xray Spoke allows your organization to build automated workflows that interact directly with the JFrog Platform. 

Focused on Xray-related actions: from generation violations reports to creating ignore rules, re-scanning builds and artifacts, assigning custom item properties, and assigning permissions to users and groups, the JFrog Xray Spoke provides out-of-the-box actions that your company can mix-and-match with other ServiceNow workflows to automate your overall IT-operations. 

# How It Works

ServiceNow Spokes are applications with predefined actions that customers can use to build workflows on the NOW Platform. The JFrog Spoke has actions that can be combined with other native Spokes from ServiceNow and other third-party tools to create enterprise-grade workflows for vulnerability and change management for all your ITSM needs.

## Features Include:

* Track Xray Vulnerabilities
* Track License Violations
* Create Ignore Rules
* Create Users
* Update Permissions
* Generate and Send Xray Violations Reports
* Trigger Scans of new Artifacts and Builds
* Manage Custom Item Properties
